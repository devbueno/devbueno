    Hey, welcome to my profile ;) !
    My name is Jonathan Bueno, 29 years old, and I love every kind of stuff related to technology. I started young on this, 9 years old, dismantling toys and electronic devices üòãüòã

    I'm currently looking for a job and also involved in two personal projects:
    
    1- Recently started to brainstorm a mobile app (iOS/Android) with a friend related to 3d image processing with a touch of AI in it. On this path I plan to learn Flutter for basic app functionallity, Java & Swift for advanced functions and general statistical concepts for IA.

    2- Cloud Drone: The core of this project involves C++ programming for robotics (you can find some pieces of code in my profile), development of a multiplatform website that will link users to the robots and Infrastructure as code (IaC) for easy cloud deployment and management. Currently I'm working on the drone's flight controller (stabilization and movement). 
        
    I'm also  studying to earn an AWS Certificate as soon as possible.
