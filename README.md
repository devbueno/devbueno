"Learning sharpens thought, broadens perspective, and empowers meaningful action."

Hey, welcome to my profile 😉!  
My name is **Jonathan Bueno**, 29 years old, and I love every kind of stuff related to technology.  
I started young on this, 9 years old, dismantling toys and electronic devices 😋😋

## 🚀 Current Status

I'm currently looking for a job and also involved in two personal "study" projects:

### 1️⃣ Mobile App with 3D & AI

Recently started to brainstorm a mobile app (iOS/Android) with a friend related to 3D image processing with a touch of AI in it.  
On this path I plan to learn **Flutter** for basic app functionality, **Java & Swift** for advanced functions, and general **statistical concepts** for AI.

### 2️⃣ Cloud Drone

The core of this project involves:
- **C++** programming for robotics (you can find some pieces of code in my profile)
- Development of a **multiplatform website** to link users to the robots (JS based + frameworks)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for easy cloud deployment and management (Terraform & Ansible)

Currently, I'm working on the **drone's flight controller** (stabilization and movement).
